# A-Star-Algoirthm-Visualizer
#### This is a solution to the shortest path problem that has been implemented using the A* Algorithm. The program provided will run a visual representation to the user through pygame. To Ensure that you have pygame installed, open the terminal in your current working directory and type<br/>
#### pip install pygame<br/>
#### The file provided has already imported pygame

## Preview
